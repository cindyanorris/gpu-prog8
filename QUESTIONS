Consider an image of size 1400 by 1000; 1400 is the width.
Assume that the image is blurred with a blur width of 3.
Blocks are of size 32 by 32.

1) What are the dimensions of the grid of blocks that is launched
to perform the blur? Give your answer as X by Y where X is
the number of blocks in the X direction and Y is the number of
blocks in the Y direction.

2) How many threads are generated by a kernel launch to handle an
image of this size?

3) How many of those threads will not write a result to the output
array?  

4) How many warps are in block?

5) Consider the block in the top left corner.  How many of the
warps in that corner are divergent?  (Consider a divergent warp one
in which some of the threads perform the convolution loop and other
threads do not. To make this simpler, ignore the possibility that some
threads won't write a result.)

6) Consider the block in the top right corner.  How many of the
warps in that corner are divergent?

7) Consider the block in the bottom left corner.  How many of the
warps in that corner are divergent?

8) Consider the block in the bottom right corner.  How many of the
warps in that corner are divergent?

9) What is the total number of divergent warps?

10) What is the percentage of warps that are divergent?
